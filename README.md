# Midas
## The Data Scrapper King

Scraping data from [UFRN](http://ufrn.br/) accountability.

The initial idea is for me to learn and pratice data science with Python. My current objective is to see how many professors have salary above the ceiling at this University.

### For development

Inspired by:
- professor [Masanori](https://github.com/fmasanori) and [its students project at USP](https://gist.github.com/fmasanori/6ae7d880da86b61b5f2736da0f341376) that have the same goal as mine; and
- a [Data Science Brigade](https://github.com/datasciencebr) project called [Serenata de Amor](https://github.com/datasciencebr/serenata-de-amor) for monitoring congressmen expenses using public money that is possibly my future goal.

### For learning

I'm already comfortable with Python basics and Object Oriented Programming. So there's my reading list:
- [Python Data Science Handbook](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook) (free!) by Jake VanderPlas;
- [Modular Programming Python](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/modular-programming-python) by Erik Westra.

After reading it all, I'll introduce more features to this project.

### Mithology

[King Midas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midas) was a greek who had the gift (and curse) of transform into gold everything he touches, even his own food and family.

~~So be careful and don't be greedy with the public money, you're being watched.~~

### Legal support

Here in Brazil, since 2011 the law [12.527](http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2011-2014/2011/lei/l12527.htm) specifies the constitutional right of every citizen to know better the public expenses. Therefore, this project is entirely legal.
