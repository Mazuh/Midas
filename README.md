# Midas
## The Data Scrapper King

Scrapping data from our federal colleges, [UFRN](http://ufrn.br/) and [IFRN](http://portal.ifrn.edu.br/), analysing expenses and producing some cool information for research.

Our Constitution, our Law and our People demand [easy access](http://portal.ifrn.edu.br/acessoainformacao/sobre-a-lei-de-acesso-a-informacao-1/apresentacao-da-lei-de-acesso-lai/at_download/file) to this kind of information in an easier way to understand.

The initial idea is for me to learn and pratice data science with Python. My current objective is to compute statistics for government employees salary. Further, more public expenses will be available for analysis.

### For development

Inspired by:
- professor [Masanori](https://github.com/fmasanori) and [its students project](https://gist.github.com/fmasanori/6ae7d880da86b61b5f2736da0f341376) that is a data scrapper for [USP](http://www5.usp.br/) salaries; and
- a [Data Science Brigade](https://github.com/datasciencebr) project called [Serenata de Amor](https://github.com/datasciencebr/serenata-de-amor) for monitoring congressmen expenses using public money (may be similar to my future goal).

### For learning

I'm already comfortable with Python basics and Object Oriented Programming. So there's my reading list:
- [Python Data Science Handbook](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook) (free!) by Jake VanderPlas;
- [Modular Programming Python](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/modular-programming-python) by Erik Westra.

After reading it all, I'll think about more features.

### Mithology

[King Midas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midas) was a greek who had the gift (and curse) of transform into gold everything he touches, even his own food and family.

~~So be careful and don't be greedy with the public money, you're being watched.~~

### Legal support

Here in Brazil, since 2011 the law [12.527](http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2011-2014/2011/lei/l12527.htm) specifies the constitutional right of every citizen to know better the public expenses. Therefore, this project is entirely legal.
