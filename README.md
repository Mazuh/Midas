Scraping data from [UFRN](http://ufrn.br/) accountability.

### For development

Inspired by:
- professor [Masanori](https://github.com/fmasanori) and [its students project at USP](https://gist.github.com/fmasanori/6ae7d880da86b61b5f2736da0f341376) that has the same goal as mine; and
- a [Data Science Brigade](https://github.com/datasciencebr) project called [Serenata de Amor](https://github.com/datasciencebr/serenata-de-amor) for monitoring congressmen expenses of public money.

### Mithology

[King Midas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midas) was a greek who had the gift (and curse) of transform into gold everything he touches, even his own food and family.

~~So be careful and don't be greedy with the public money, you're being watched.~~

### Legal support

Here in Brazil, since 2011 the law [12.527](http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2011-2014/2011/lei/l12527.htm) specifies the constitutional right of every citizen to know better the public expenses. Therefore, this project is entirely legal.
